# Synopsys

kconfig is an isolated packaging of the kernel configuration tools
as found in the scripts/kconfig/ directory of the kernel sources.

The purpose is to provide the great functionalities of the kernel
configuration mechanism to any project that need application
level configuration.

# Usage

On can extract kconfig sources and run without installation
from his own project directory:

$ cd myproject/
$ kconfig/config.sh manuconfig

As a default the mypoject/Kconfig file must be present for
declaring the project configuration.
The result is a myproject/config file which can be sources in
a shell of makefile script.

Alternatively the call to:

$ kconfig/config.sh menuconfig

can be replaced by a direct call to the kconfig/GNUmakefile:

$ make -f kconfig/GNUmakefile TOPDIR=. SRCDIR=kconfig

Note that all common kernel configuration targets are available,
in particular config, menuconfig, nconfig, gconfig, xconfig,
defconfig, oldconfig, etc...

Get the list of targets with:

$ kconfig/config.sh help

or

$ make -f kconfig/GNUmakefile help TOPDIR=. SRCDIR=kconfig
